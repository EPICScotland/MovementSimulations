Repository for movement simulation code and test data.

AnimalMovementSimulations
=========================

The AnimalMovementSimulations Java project generates simulated animal movement data for use with Broadwick, particularly for the Broadwick tutorial examples.  Since the examples are based upon the implemented Soho model (which uses Broadwick), this project focuses on simulating cattle movements and CTS data, although different livestock scenarios might be added later.

Please see the AnimalMovementSimulations.pdf document in the AnimalMovementSimulations/doc folder for more information, on the source code and how to run the RandomMovementSimulator.jar command line java application.

Example simulated cattle movement data can be found in the AnimalMovementSimulations/simulations folder.
